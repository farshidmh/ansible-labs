# **Using `include_tasks` in Ansible - Simple Example Without Conditions**

## **Overview**

In this lab, you'll learn how to use `include_tasks` in Ansible to include separate task files without using any conditions. This basic example will help you understand how to split tasks across multiple files and include them in your playbook.

## **Objectives**

- Use `include_tasks` to include task files in a playbook.

## **Prerequisites**

- Ansible installed on your control node.
- At least one managed host.

## **Duration**

15 minutes

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1: Create Task Files**

1. **Create a Task File Named `common_tasks.yml`:**

   - Create a file named `common_tasks.yml` with the following content:

     ```yaml
     ---
     - name: Debug message for common tasks
       debug:
         msg: "Running common tasks for all environments"
     ```

2. **Create a Task File Named `env_specific_tasks.yml`:**

   - Create a file named `env_specific_tasks.yml` with the following content:

     ```yaml
     ---
     - name: Debug message for environment-specific tasks
       debug:
         msg: "Running environment-specific tasks"
     ```

### **Step 2: Create the Main Playbook**

1. Create a playbook file named `include_tasks_play.yml` with the following content:

   ```yaml
   ---
   - hosts: all
     gather_facts: no

     tasks:
       - name: Include common tasks
         include_tasks: common_tasks.yml

       - name: Include environment-specific tasks
         include_tasks: env_specific_tasks.yml
   ```

### **Step 3: Run the Playbook**

1. Save the playbook and task files.

2. Run the playbook using the following command:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook include_tasks_play.yml
   ```

3. The playbook will include and execute both task files, and you will see debug messages from both `common_tasks.yml` and `env_specific_tasks.yml`.

## **Conclusion**

In this simple lab, you've learned how to use `include_tasks` to load multiple task files into an Ansible playbook. This method allows you to organize tasks into separate files and reuse them in different playbooks.
